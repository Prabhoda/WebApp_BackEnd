# WebApp_BackEnd
A backend of a web app is the part that handles the logic, data, and functionality of the app. It is not visible to the user, but it is essential for the app to work properly. 
The backend consists of three main components: servers, databases, and frameworks.

Servers are the machines that host the web app and communicate with the userâ€™s browser. They run the backend code and process the requests from the front end.

Databases are the systems that store and manage the data of the web app. They can be relational or non-relational, depending on the structure and complexity of the data.

Frameworks are the tools and libraries that help the backend developers write the code and build the features of the web app. They provide a set of predefined functions, modules, and templates that simplify the development process.
